# MG5_aMC@NLO exercises

These exercises are related to a course about `mg5_aMC@NLO` held in June 2020.

## Author and collaborators

The author of these solutions is _Alessandro Candido_.

I would like to thank _Roy Stegeman_ and _Adriano Vigan√≤_ that collaborated with
me in understanding a little bit more of `madgraph` and working out these
solutions.
