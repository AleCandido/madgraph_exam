# Dark Matter candidate

The results are those in:

- `_day3_sm`: for the SM background
- `_day3_dm`: `run_03` and `run_04` for the Dark Matter

For each there is a couple of run, one for each chosen value of the `ptj` cut:
50 GeV and 200 GeV.

## Process description

The chosen process is `p p > j + inv.` at LHC, following the analysis of
_arXiv:1508.00564_.

Following the mentioned analysis the cross sections are computed for two values
of the cut on the `ptj`: $50 GeV$ and $200 GeV$ (of course for both SM and DM
theories).

The PDFset used is always "MSTW2008lo90cl"

### SM background

The main standard model background is the $Z$ decay in neutrinos, since they are
the only invisible particles in the SM, and only the $Z$ is able to couple and
decay in neutrino pairs at LO (must be a neutral boson and since neutrinos are
electrically discharged even the photon is ruled out).

### DM signal

The scenario analysed is the one that in the previously referenced paper is
called "resonant".
