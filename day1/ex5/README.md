# Exercise 5

## part (a)

The cross-sections found are the following:

- LHC: $505.7 \pm 0.79$ pb
- Tevatron: $0.3213 \pm 0.00045$ pb

The result (ratio between channels) is due mainly to the proton structure:

- at low energies the proton is mainly made by the valence quarks, so the quark
  channel is contributing much more
  - the ratio at Tevatron is $ \sim 317 / 4 = 79 $
  - moreover colliding proton against antiproton more `q q~` pairs are
    available in the input, since they the antiproton has valence antiquarks to
    annihilate against the valence quarks of the proton
- the gluon is mainly generated by PDF evolution, and it's contribution is
  increasing for low `x` and high `Q2`
  - the ratio at LHC is $ \sim 64 / 441 = 0.145 $

### running madgraph

The detailed description of the runs is in `script.mg5`.

- in the first run simply generate the process (LHC is the default)
- in the second run: set
  ```
  -1 = lpp2
  490.0 = ebeam1
  490.0 = ebeam2
  ```
  in the `run_card.dat` file

## part (b)

The actual result for `p p > t t~ j` at LHC is:

- $ 546.7 pb $

to be compared with the:

- $ 505.7 $

of `p p > t t~`, also at LHC.

The cross section is then increased, mainly because a new channel is opened,
since one of the incoming parton might be a quark that emits a jet and turn into
a gluon, coupling to the gluon from the other proton.

So:

- `p p > t t~`: only `gg` and `qq~` channel available to make an s-channel gluon
- `p p > t t~ j`: a new channel adds, the `gq`/`gq~` channel

(actually the other two channels are contributing less in the second process).

### running madgraph

The detailed description of the runs is in `script.mg5`.

- set
  ```
  20.0 = ptj
  4.0 = etaj
  ```
  in the `run_card.dat` file
