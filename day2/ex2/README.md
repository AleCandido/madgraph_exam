# Exercise 2

Since the K-factor is the ratio of NLO and LO the two have been computed using
`MG5aMC`, as it is described in `script.mg5`.

The results are stored in the file `results.txt`.

The K-factor is:

$$
5.479e-01 +- 1.9e-03 pb / 5.320e-01 +- 3.2e-03 pb = 1.030 +- 0.0071
$$

(for the error on the K-factor see next exercise, essentially it's obtained by
summing in quadrature)
