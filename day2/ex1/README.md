# Exercise 1

## part (a)

The plot can be found in the file `me(kt).pdf`, and it has been created by the
script `part_a_plot.py`.

The same dead cone described in the exam sheet is observed.

## part (c)

The instructions for obtaining the `MG5_aMC` results are in the file
`script.mg5`, and the results themselves are stored in the file
`scan_run_[01-10].txt` as extracted for the `MG5_aMC` output.

The results have been plotted by the script `part_b_plot.py`, and the resulting
plot is stored in the file `xs(mb).pdf`.
